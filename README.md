README
======

This is my fork of the [hvfrancescos modified version](https://github.com/hvfrancesco/ofxSimpleGuiToo) of [ofxSimpleGuiToo](https://github.com/memo/ofxSimpleGuiToo).

It is updated to compile with openFrameworks 0.8.4 and fixes some bugs in the ComboBox and the ColorPicker.

It is optimized for [my fork of LPMT - Little Projection-Mapping Tool](https://github.com/Foaly/lpmt).
But feel free to use it for whatever you want. As far as I can tell this is the most recently updated version of ofxSimpleGuiToo.
